# Shopify - Movie Nominations

This project was created for Shopify's front-end technical challenge. Could it look better? Definitely. But it exceeds the requirements and I had a blast building it, so I'm content.

Production link: https://main.d19dzfddg2ad74.amplifyapp.com

## Technologies used:

I built this simple application with React. While I also could've used fancy CSS precompilers or a cool styling framework like Bootstrap or Ant design, I decided to keep it simple and write vanilla CSS.

It's hosted using AWS Amplify.

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
